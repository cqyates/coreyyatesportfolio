        <h1><strong> About Me </strong></h1>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" id="profile-pic" src="assets/images/corey.jpg"> My name is Corey Yates.  I am a small business owner who sells vintage sewing patterns through a four platform web business.
          I have a degree in History from the University of California at Berkeley.  While I love what I do, I started coding bootcamp 
          because I am ready for a challenging new career in full stack web development.</p>
              
          <p> Learning has always been really important to me.  I love to read and write. I am passionate about politics and current events.  
          I was a canvaser for the Stacey Abrams gubnatorial campaign in 2018.  I am skilled at approaching strangers and pitching them on my candidate or the importance of voting.
          After the election, I was thanked personally by Stacey with a group of 30 other "super volunteers" who had contributed the most to the campaign. Political activism is very important to 
          me, and I will be volunteering as a canvaser in every election.</p>
              
          <p> I love my business and all that we have managed to accomplish in 15 years.  I have built up from a single ebay name to a branded business that sells on Etsy,
          Ebay, our own website powered by Shopify and in niche Facebook groups.  I run social media campaigns and have thousands of follows and even fans who reach out often to 
          tell us how much they love our business.  However, at this point, I am looking for a much bigger challenge.  I am learning wonderful new languages and tools that I want to deploy for businesses and corporations of all sizes.

    <h5> Developer and Copywriter 2003-2008 </h5>
    <h5> Owner and Operator 2008-2019</h5>
    <br>
    <p> I have 15 years experience in eccomerce.  As the owner and operator of Vintage4me2, I have developed a web presence on Ebay and Etsy and developed my own Shopify store.</p>
    <p> I am a small business owner so I have many jobs that contribute to building our website.  I handle inventory tracking and am responsible for our growing email list and email campaigns.  I write our ads with the help of programs that test keywords for SEO optimization. I both buy ads and run social media campaigns that generate traffic organically.</p>
    <p> As a long time crafter I know what applications pattern collectors and costumers need.  I have two applications in development.  The first one is a MERN stack application that will create a large database of pattern catalog pages that users can search to find a catalog reference to a pattern, this service will enable costumers to date their patterns down to the season.  I plan on releasing this application as a subscription service to fellow historical fashion enthusiasts in January 2020.  I am also in development on another MERN stack application that will allow pattern collectors to keep a record of their patterns with images and information that will make it easy to search later. In the end this application will be integrated with my website so buyers can seamlessly add their new pattern to their collection.</p>
